# OLT unblock
This is a **WIP** open-source tool intended to enable users to mantain multiple OLTs unblocked when the vendor makes the unblock commands volatile.

## Run
```python manage.py runserver```

## MVP
- [ ] Access control
- [ ] Add a list of OLTs

  - [ ] UP, PENDING
    - [ ] OLT is up and waiting to be unblocked
  - [ ] DOWN, COUNTING
    - [ ] OLT is down in a short period of time
  - [ ] DOWN, WAITING
    - [ ] OLT is down for some time and is waiting to come up
- [ ] Access OLT
  - [ ] Scrap Boards and versions
  - [ ] Monitor
